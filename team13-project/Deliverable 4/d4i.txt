5) Simon

-still need to do arrow heads
-more testing
-error checking

simon - going to be working on adding arrow heads to projection lines
andrei and ranauk - working on parsing the string into the line and the scatter
points (error checking that)
david and tony - are doing testing

at some point code cleanup

-while they were writing their functions, should have done error checking before
will be harder now
-could have thought of test cases as functions were growing

Feel as though they've used the time pretty effectively.
