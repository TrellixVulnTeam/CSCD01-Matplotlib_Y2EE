User wanted a gradient of arrows on graph, bodies are correct but, the arrow
heads don't match.

Think it'll be really hard just to make the arrow heads change colour.

-tight layout is supposed to prevent the titles of axes from going beyond the figure,
the bug is saying this isn't working, shouldn't be able to be greater than the top.

-thinking about cutting off the extra text when using tight layout
-will be solving it a different way, from the PR's listed on the issue page
by truncating the text if using tight layout
-probably on the easier side, but will have to look into the method, listed fixes look short

-certain characters like delta or other greek letters if they are capitalized, they are
not italiczed.

-works fine for english letters, only for non latex characters as well
-this bug was found when writing to pdf's
-will investigate wether or not this is present in the font or if matplotlib
might not being using it correctly
-could be a bigger issue if other characters are affected.
-could be willing to create a italiszed triangle if needed

Should probably avoid this one.

bug4) David
Issue  #: 9056
Comments: Seems quite easy and may already be solved.  Merged

Demoing  bug: 0.5 / 0.5
Explaination: 0.5 / 0.5

-when you try to save a figure, uses the figure name, doesn't check for invalid
characters, windows will throw an error
-would have to reacreate figure without the characters to fix it

Ideally would avoid this one.

bug5) Andrei
Issue  #: 8422
Comments: Seems reasonable difficult, but looks like only documentation is left.

Demoing  bug: 0.5 / 0.5
Explaination: 0.5 / 0.5

-colour mesh has two types of shading, flat and gouraud
-gouraud fails with certains parameters that work with flat
-shouldn't crash like it currently does
-gouraud is just a type of shading.


-current fix is sort of a rework of gouraud with different params passed
-colormesh has the ability to reshape things in order to work and at the very
least they could implement a warning and reshape using colourmesh

-confident they can get it to produce some kind of shading

Good bug, doing it this way.


Extra:
13131: Good issue if actually bug.
13035: Could be cood
13007: Might already be fixed.
