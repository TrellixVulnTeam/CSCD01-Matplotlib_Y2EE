Interview for Deliverable 2 Part 2
Team 13

1) Ranauk

bugs finished (3):
-arrow head colour didn't match body
-x axis and y axis wasn't fitting a long label within them, fixed by truncated
the text until it fit,
-garaud, other method was flat but gaurud wasn't working, fixed by catching
exceptions and modifying input so that it could output something
-no pr's

-all the rest were dropped by my recommendation

2) David

-truncating label text
-if label is too long, cannot use tight layout template would warn you
-now, there are no warning because it will truncate the text in the label
-replaces with ... for the remainder of the label
-works for x and y axes
-fits when text is small enough

4) Simon

-for each of their bugs, involved a specific situation such as colours,
or tight layout or using garaud so they felt like there weren't test cases
for these situations, so they felt like it shouldn't affect anything else
-they use pytest
-have a bunch of test files for different classes and things
-should have tested their bugs

5) Tony

-gouraud
-before just crashed if the value was off (worked with flat)
-now shows a colourmap

-added in _axes.py
-it detects if gouraud shading, and if it is catches exceptions
and adjusts the parameters so that it doesn't fail
-the cause of it failing, is when x, y differed by more than one, so they
change the values so that they're in the same range
-seems to be in the Axes class under the pcolormesh function
-detects if the params fail in gouraud but work in flat
